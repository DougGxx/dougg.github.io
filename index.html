      <h2>Hiking in Phoenix</h2>
      <p>
        For those who live in the Phoenix Metro area or are just visiting and would like to get out on a hike then I've
        got several suggestions for hikes and areas to hike in. Two of the areas offer a multitude of trails ranging
        from easy to difficult to do. One area I recommend has only two trails and they're both rated difficult
        (Camelback Mountain). So, you need to be in good shape and bring plenty of water to try this one. Two hiking
        areas that I recommend have bathrooms and drinking water available (Camelback trails and the Gateway entrance to
        the McDowell Sonoran preserve. If you try any trails please let me know what you think in the Contact section.
