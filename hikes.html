            The Cholla Trail trailhead is located at 5150 N. Invergordon Road. There is a bathroom, water drinking
            fountain, sinks and bike racks available. There are no designated parking spots at the trailhead, and
            limited street parking is available near the trailhead. Hikers are required to parallel park in specific,
            designated sections along the west side of Invergordon Road. Once parked, there is a gravel path that
            parallels the south side of Cholla Lane and leads to the trailhead. Multiple spots painted with a yellow
            curb are designated drop-off areas for ride shares. The trail traverses the eastern slope or "hump" of
            Camelback Mountain and is 1.5 miles in length. Both trails have been rated as difficult since it can be very
            steep at times. This hike is around 1.5 miles in length.

            The Piestewa Peak Summit Trail is located in Piestewa Peak Park. There is limited parking in the park 2701
            Piestewa Peak Dr, Phoenix, AZ. Picnic tables are available and dogs are allowed. Piestewa Peak Summit Trail
            is a popular but challenging hike with steep terrain, rocky footing, and rocky stairs, providing a great
            workout with stunning views of the Phoenix area. Recent reviews mention heavy foot traffic, especially on
            weekends, and recommend going early to avoid crowds. The trail is well-marked, with most people friendly and
            encouraging. Sturdy hiking shoes with good traction are necessary due to the rocky terrain. Some parts of
            the trail involve boulders and scrambles towards the peak. Sunset or sunrise hikes are recommended for
            beautiful views. The trail typically has heavy traffic, rock stairs, and offers a challenging workout with
            incredible panoramic views. In March, the area may experience mild temperatures, making it an ideal time for
            outdoor activities. The length of this trail is 1.2 miles.
