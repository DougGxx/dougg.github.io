      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I've been hiking for over a decade. Years ago I realized I was leading a sedentary lifestyle testing software
        and playing video games. I enjoy the outdoors and thought that hiking would be a healthy way to experience
        nature. I started out slow and over the course of several months I could do a moderately difficult hike of 4 or
        5 miles. With the hiking and a sensible diet I was able to drop around 20 pounds. Right now, Iâ€™m taking a break
        from work and plan to section hike the Pacific Crest Trail (the trail runs from just outside San Diego to Canada
        and is around 2,650 miles. some time in the future. I hope you take advantage of these trails and enjoy them as
        much as I do.
